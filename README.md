Been There, Seen That: Visualization of 3D eye tracking data from real world environments
This Project allows you to analyze 3D gaze and movement data sets recorded using the HoloLens 2. 
It provides you with a gaze replay visualization, which is linked to a space-time cube visualization to show an overview of the behavioral data and inspect important events in more detail.
